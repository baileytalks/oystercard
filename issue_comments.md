STEP 2

Here's the issue:

"/Users/baileykursar/Projects/oystercard/spec/oystercard_spec.rb:2:in <top (required)>: uninitialized constant Oystercard (NameError)"

It's showing us the NameError because we've named Oystercard with a capital letter, without actually creating the class in the program.

We suggest solving this by creating an Oyster class in the program.
